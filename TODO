TODO for 2.5:

  * Review whether the OTP plumbing is correct

DONE for 2.5:

  * Verify basic communication with USB device manager (get device list)

  * Move APP_NAME and SERVER_NAME definitions to appropriate place.

TODO:

  * Simplify comm protocol with Erlang port. Should make parsing and
    constructing messages easier. Use less string comparisons, more
    table indexes.

  * Rename erlpkg* variables to erlusb*, avoid PACKAGE_NAME in *.app
    files. We might want to put another Erlang app into this package,
    e.g. an example garmin.app.

  * Check parallel builds (make -j). There might be some dependencies
    missing and thus the parallel build might or even will fail.

DONE:
